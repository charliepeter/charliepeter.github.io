# Bessel's Correction (Why do we divide sample varinace by n-1?)

A common mistake that I've made many times is to confuse the conecpt of sample variance and variance. On the surface level they seem to be the same thing, but when we get down a bit more into the details it seems like they have an important dictinction.
